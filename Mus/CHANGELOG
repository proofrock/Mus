Version 0.3.1   28 Jul 2015

* Table scrolls to last processed file

* Improvements and bugfixes with size calculation/verification

Version 0.3.0   28 Jul 2015

* Renamed to Mus

* Specified other tooltips

* Added file length to checksum files (potentially faster error detection)

* Removed some retrocompatibility features, as the program is very different now

Version 0.2.1	27 Jul 2015

* Bugfix when checksumming files containing non-ascii chars

Version 0.2.0	27 Jul 2015

* New, emoji-based, graphics

* Show information on numbers of OK files, errors, size.

Version 0.1.0	25 Jul 2015

* Ask before overwriting files

* Added checksumming of the Summy file itself (involves a file format change)

* Solved a bug: loading a summy file saved in Windows won't work in *nix. 

* File format change: now all the backslashes are converted in slashes when saving.

* File format change: The original base directory is not saved anymore

* New versioning: major/minor/build

Version 0.10	24 Jul 2015

  are one or more .summy files, the user will be prompted to verify them. 

Version 0.9		23 Jul 2015

* Row is colored in yellow if an error has occoured

* Further refactoring

Version 0.8		22 Jul 2015

* Number of worker threads can be configured, and now defaults at NUM_CORES + 1. It is infact
  necessary to set 1 worker thread when dealing with optical media and possibly HDD, as the file
  seeks are really slow and it's important to read sequencially 1 file per time.
  
* In CLI mode, worker threads are always 1 (for now) 

* Added a proper toolbar (simple buttons were rather ugly)

* Added status icons to file tables (as first column)

* Usual refactorings

* Added buttons with icons

* Added a button to save checksum file directly to automatical location

* Added confirmation dialog after saving file

Version 0.5		18 Jul 2015

* Added indication of speed, ETA and time elapsed

* CLI mode: -a switch to auto-name the checksum file to save

* CLI mode: now it's possible to specify more than one dir/file to checksum

* Bugfix: Application in CLI mode won't exit when finished

* Bugfix: Using paths relative to current directory provoked a NullPointerException

* Refactoring to class structure and code style fixes

Version 0.4		18 Jul 2015

* Refinements to the routine that decides the checksum file name

* Bugfix to checksum file saving

* Fix to form layout

* Added status indicators when building tree and calculating checksums

* Refactoring to event-based "file walker"

Version 0.3		18 Jul 2015
